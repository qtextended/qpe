<h2>Building from Source Code</h2>

<p>
This package should work fine with Qt/X11 and Qt/Windows, but
it is targetted at small handheld devices such as the Compaq iPAQ, and
includes some Qt/Embedded specifics such as additional input methods for
virtual keyboards and handwriting recognition. Similarly, it's easy
to make an existing Qt-base program part of Qt Palmtop, but usually you will
make changes such as simplifying the UI and reducing the screen-space
required by the application.

<p>
The source code to Qt Palmtop is available from the
<a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpe/>SourceForge respository</a>,
via <a href=http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=16158>CVS</a>, or download
a recent <a href=ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/embedded/palmtop/>source code release</a>.

<p>
To build the package, you have a number of options, each described
in detail below. The instructions assume you have unpacked the source code
and all commands are relative to the top-level source directory, which is
also referred to as $QPEDIR.

<p>
Before building Qt Palmtop, you need to have
<a href=http://www.trolltech.com/products/download/freelicense/qtfree-dl.html>Qt/X11</a>
installed on your development system, because you need the <tt>uic</tt> command
from Qt/X11 (uic needs the "Everything" configuration as it uses properties).
Having Qt/X11 on your system will also allow you to use the Qt Designer under X11,
which is a great way to build user interfaces (most of the applications in
Qt Palmtop have been designed with the Designer). Note that since Qt/Embedded and
Qt/X11 have different library names (libqte and libqt), both can
safely be on your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or even stored in the same
directory.

<p>
For all build types you will need to build Qt/Embedded in some way. You can download
Qt/Embedded from <a href=http://www.trolltech.com/products/download/freelicense/qtfree-dl-emb.html>the Trolltech website</a>.
<p>
Sometimes, the latest CVS snapshot will require a snapshot of Qt/Embedded. Look
<a href=http://qpe.sourceforge.net/snapshots/qte/>here</a> for available snapshots
and use the latest if there is no more-recent public Qt/Embedded release.
<p>
Before building it, check to see if there is a patch required for Qt Palmtop by
looking at $QPEDIR/qt/*.patch for a patch matching the Qt/Embedded version
you are compiling with, and apply the patch with:

<pre>
    cd $QTDIR
    patch -p0 -s &lt;$QPEDIR/qt/qte???-for-qpe.patch
</pre>

Try to always use the latest Qt/Embedded version and the
latest Qt Palmtop version.

<a name=single>
<h3>Static single-application build</h3>
</a>

<p>
This build method gives the smallest and fastest result, and reflects
a type of build that an embedded device might use when the application
suite is more-or-less fixed.

<ol>
    <li> Install the Qt Palmtop configurations, which are tuned to the requirements
	    of Qt Palmtop and exclude certain functionality from the Qt library in
	    order to minimize the size of the resulting executable:
<pre>
    cp ./qt/qconfig*.h $QTDIR/src/tools
</pre>
    </p>
    <li> Build Qt/Embedded statically and with the "-qconfig qpe-single"
	    configuration which uses the files copied above.
	    Be sure to delete any
	    existing dynamic versions as the linker will prefer those:
<pre>
    cd $QTDIR
    make clean
    ./configure -static -qconfig qpe-single
    make
</pre>

	<p>This creates <tt>$QTDIR/lib/libqte.a</tt>.

    </p>
    <li> Build the entire Qt Palmtop package as a single application:
<pre>
    cd <i>back-here</i>
    make clean
    ./configure -static
    make single
</pre>

	<p>This creates <tt>$QTDIR/lib/libqpe.a</tt> and <tt>single/qpe</tt>.
    </p>

    <li> Strip the executable:
<pre>
    strip -R .note -R .comment single/qpe
</pre>
    </p>

    <li>
	Set the QPEDIR environment variable to the
	base directory of Qt Palmtop, e.g <tt>export QPEDIR=~/qpe</tt>
    </p>

    <li> You now have an executable "single/qpe", which includes a complete
	windowing system, multiple input methods, and a reasonable collection
	of nifty little applications.
    </p>
</ol>

<a name=dynamic>
<h3>Dynamic build</h3>
</a>

<p>
This build method gives the most extensible result, and reflects
a kind of build that an embedded device might use when the application
suite is extended by the end-user.

<ol>
    <li> Install the Qt Palmtop configurations, which are tuned to the requirements
	    of Qt Palmtop and exclude certain functionality from the Qt library in
	    order to minimize the size of the resulting executable:
<pre>
    cp ./qt/qconfig*.h $QTDIR/src/tools
</pre>
    </p>
    <li> Build Qt/Embedded dynamically and with the "-qconfig qpe"
	    option which uses the files copied above:
<pre>
    cd $QTDIR
    make clean
    ./configure -qconfig qpe
    make
</pre>

	<p>This creates <tt>$QTDIR/lib/libqte.so*</tt>.

	You can of course use the default "Everything" Qt configuration, which
	isn't in the spirit of making small applications, but is useful if you
	want to have the entire Qt API available.

    </p>

    <li> Build the entire Qt Palmtop package:
<pre>
    cd <i>back-here</i>
    make clean
    ./configure
    make
</pre>

	<p>This creates <tt>$QTDIR/lib/libqpe.so*</tt> and <tt>bin/*</tt>,
	including a <tt>bin/qpe</tt> that launchers applications as separate
	processes (rather than as built-ins which the single-application
	build does).
    </p>

    <li> Strip the executables, libraries, and plugins:
<pre>
    strip -R .note -R .comment bin/*
    strip -R .note -R .comment $QTDIR/lib/libqte.so* $QTDIR/lib/libqpe.so*
    strip -R .note -R .comment plugins/*/*
</pre>
    </p>

    <li>
	Set the QPEDIR environment variable to the
	base directory of Qt Palmtop, e.g <tt>export QPEDIR=~/qpe</tt>
    </p>

    <li> You now have a collection of applications in the <tt>bin/</tt>
	directory, which includes
	a complete windowing system, multiple input methods, and a
	collection of applications.
    </p>

    <li> To add more applications, see the section below on
	<a href=development.html>writing your own applications</a>.
    </p>
</ol>

<p>
Note that the memory consumption with this type of build is currently excessive
due to the details of ELF, but there are a number of tools in production to
alleviate this, such as
<a href=ftp://people.redhat.com/jakub/prelink/>ELF Prelink</a>.

<a name=ipaqbuild>
<h3>Build for iPAQ</h3>
</a>

<p>
To build Qt Palmtop from the sources:

<ol>
    <li> <a href=ipaq.html>Install Linux on the iPAQ</a>,
	    and possible also some existing parts or Qt Palmtop by following.
    <li> Install
	<a href=ftp://ftp.handhelds.org/pub/linux/arm/toolchain/>the
	ARM cross-compiler from handhelds.org</a>.
    </p>
    <li> Build the Qt library and the Qt Palmtop package
	by following the instructions above for
	the <a href=#dynamic>Dynamic</a> build, but
	add the <tt>-xplatform linux-ipaq-g++</tt> options
	when you run both <tt>configure</tt> commands (you can also
	add the <tt>-depths 16,32</tt> option when compiling Qt since
	16bpp is the depth of the iPAQ screen and adding 32 means you can
	also have pixmaps with alpha-channels).
	You can also use the <>a href=#single>Single</a> build, but then
	you'll not be able to interoperate with Qt Palmtop installations on
	other iPAQs.
    </p>
    <li> Run <tt>mkipks */*.control</tt> to regenerate <tt>.ipk</tt> files
	which you can then install. You can also just run <tt>mkipks</tt> with
	a single control file to regenerate just that package.
    </p>
</ol>
