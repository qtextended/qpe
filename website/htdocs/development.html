<h2>Writing your own applications</h2>
</a>

<p>
Developing an application to add to your Qt Palmtop is just like developing
any other application with the Qt API. You have all the same classes
and functionality.


<h3>Special design considerations with Qt Palmtop</h3>

You can develop your application using Qt/X11 or Qt/Window
and just recompile it for Qt/Embedded, but you should keep in mind
a number of differences in the devices that are commonly running Qt Palmtop:

<p>
<dl>
    <dt><b>Smaller display</b>
    <dd>Require no more than about 240x240 pixels. Use QTabBar to organize
	functionality into separate groups, or just
	<i>reduce the functionality</i> - you don't need to provide every
	possible feature on a palm-sized version of your application.
	Note that the default font in Qt/Embedded is smaller than that
	for Qt/X11 and Qt/Windows.
	</p>
    <dt><b>Worse Keyboard</b>
    <dd>Organize functionality to be less dependent on keyboard input and
	more dependent on mouse input. Try using a QComboBox where you
	might otherwise have used a QLineEdit and thus provide a "History"
	list of previously typed choices.
	</p>
    <dt><b>Different Mouse</b>
    <dd>Handheld devices commonly use a stylus, which means only one mouse button,
	and no mouseMoveEvent() if the "mouse button" is not "pressed".
	You can provide "right mouse-button" functionality with the
	"press and hold" convention (eg. the menu in Filebrowser, flags in
	Minesweep). Avoid "mouse over" type events.
	</p>
</dl>


<p>
As with any application development with Qt/Embedded,
the Qt Virtual Framebuffer
tool in <tt>$QTDIR/src/tools/qvfb</tt> is a very useful development aide,
since you can control the display size and run with the exact fonts.

<p>
As with any development with Qt, the Qt Designer tool in
<tt>$QTDIR/tools/designer</tt> helps you organize functionality visually
so you can more easily create a small yet logical and functional GUI.

<p>
Qt Palmtop is less file-oriented than a typical Unix workstation: the user
probably doesn't want to worry about file and directories, just the names
of the document they have written that are appropriate for the application
they are running.

<p>
To support this more document-centric model, the Qt Palmtop library classes provide
a basic document selector and file manager. See the FileSelector and
FileManager classes defined in
<tt>library/fileselector.h</tt> and <tt>library/filemanager.h</tt>. These
mechanism are very simplistic currently, and they'll develop as the system
improves.

<h3>File structure for new applications in Qt Palmtop</h3>

A new application (let's call it <tt>foo</tt>) can be incorporated into
the directory structure of Qt Palmtop with these easy steps:

<ol>
    <li>Install the latest version of
<a href=http://www.trolltech.com/products/download/freebies/tmake.html>tmake</a>.
    </p>

    <li>Create a new subdirectory <tt>qpe/foo</tt>.
    </p>
    <li>Write your source code in <tt>qpe/foo</tt> and
	write a tmake project file, <tt>qpe/foo/foo.pro</tt>,
	file that looks like the other <tt>qpr/*/*.pro</tt> files.
    <li>Add your directory to <tt>qpe/Makefile</tt> and re-run the
	<tt>configure</tt> script. This will create a <tt>Makefile.in</tt>
	and a <tt>Makefile</tt>. The <tt>Makefile.in</tt> should be distributed
	with you package so that others don't need tmake to install Qt Palmtop.
    </p>
    <li>Compile your application:
<pre>
    cd qpe/foo
    make
</pre>
    </p>
    <li>Add a <tt>foo.desktop</tt> file somewhere in <tt>qpe/apps</tt>,
	such as <tt>qpe/apps/Applications/foo.desktop</tt>. This file
	supports a subset of the functionality of standard <tt>.desktop</tt>
	files found in KDE. For example:
<pre>
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Foo Viewer
    Icon=foo_icon
    MimeType=video/foo
    Exec=foo
</pre>
	Unrecognized fields are ignored, and if they are used in the future,
	it will be according to the standard interpretations.
    </p>
    <li>Create an icon for your application in <tt>pics/foo/icon.png</tt>
    </p>
    <li>Package up your application, including your pics/ and apps/ files...
<pre>
    tar cfz foo.tar.gz qpe/pics/foo/* \
	qpe/apps/Applications/foo.desktop qpe/foo
</pre>
    and put the package on a web site for others to share!
    <li>If you want to make it easy to build binary packages of your application
	on the iPAQ, make a control file similar to the other */*.control files -
	running <tt>mkipks</tt> on your control file will package up an iPAQ binary.
    </p>
</ol>

<h3>Adding applications to the single-application build</h3>

To add an application to the
<a href=build.html#single>single-application build</a>, follow the procedure above, but 
with the following extras:

<ul>
    <li>Put your <tt>main()</tt> in a file called <tt>main.cpp</tt>
    <li>Ensure your mainwindow class has a constructor that has
	the standard arguments <tt>(QWidget* parent, const char* name, WFlags )</tt>.
    <li>Add your program to the list in <pre>taskbar/apps.h</pre>
    <li>In <tt>single/</tt>, run <tt>makepro</tt> - this adds all <tt>.h</tt>
	and <tt>.cpp</tt> files in <tt>single/../*</tt> to <tt>single.pro</tt>.
    <li>Re-generate the Makefile from the generated <tt>single.pro</tt> file:
    <pre>
	cd qpe/single
	export TMAKEPATH=~/tmake/lib/qws/linux-<i>generic</i>-g++
	tmake -o Makefile single.pro
    </pre>
    <li>Follow the <a href=build.html#single>single-application build</a> instructions.
</ul>

<h3>Running Qt Palmtop applications on your device</h3>

<ol>
 <li>Ensure that <tt>$QTDIR/lib/fonts/</tt> contains fonts and the <tt>fontdir</tt> file.
 <li>Ensure that <tt>$QPEDIR/pics/</tt> contains the pictures for the applications.
 <li>Set and export <tt>QWS_DISPLAY=Transformed:Rot270:0</tt> if you're running
	on a device that requires screen rotation (eg. iPAQ).
 <li>The recommended locations for installing are the components are
	<tt>QTDIR="/usr"</tt> and <tt>QPEDIR="/opt/QtPalmtop"</tt>.
</ol>
