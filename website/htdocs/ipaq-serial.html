<h1>Installing on an iPAQ <i>without</i> Internet access</h1>

<ul>
<li>
Go to <a href=http://familiar.handhelds.org/familiar/releases/latest/install/H3600/install.html>http://familiar.handhelds.org</a>,
and install Familiar Linux on your iPAQ. You need only install the bootstrap
installation (ie. you can stop before installing X11, etc.). 
</p>

<li>
To install additional packages on you iPAQ, you must transfer them
(via ZModem or XModem) to the <tt>/tmp</tt> directory on the iPAQ, them install them
manually using <tt>ipkg</tt>.
You must ensure all dependencies are maintained. So, to install
a package called <tt>foo</tt>, download the <tt>foo_*.ipk</tt> package 
from the Internet and transfer it to <tt>/tmp</tt> on your iPAQ, then run:
<pre>
   ipkg install /tmp/foo_*.ipk
</pre>
Then, check that you have installed all the packages it depends on:
<pre>
   ipkg info foo
</pre>
This will give you full details.
<p>
The web site for Qt Palmtop <tt>.ipk</tt> files is:
<a href=http://qpe.sourceforge.net/packages/ipaq/>http://qpe.sourceforge.net/packages/ipaq/</a>.
Detailed descriptions of the packages are in the
<a href=http://qpe.sourceforge.net/packages/ipaq/Packages>Packages</a> file.
</p>

<li>
Install <tt>h3600-utils</tt> and <tt>apmd</tt> if you want backlight and power
management to work (you do).
</p>

<li>
Before you proceed, you'll need at least 2.5M free flash. The <tt>df</tt>
command will tell you how much you have free.
Use <tt>ipkg remove </tt><i>packagename</i> to remove some packages
(<tt>ipkg list</tt> will show you a list of them).
</p>

<li>
Install the base Qt Palmtop packages:
  <ul>
    <li>qt-embedded
    <li>qpe-taskbar
    <li>qpe-base
    <li>qpe-sounds
    <li>qpe-pics
  </ul>
</p>

<li>
Reboot your iPAQ:
<pre>
    reboot
</pre>
</p>

<li>
Install any additional Qt Palmtop packages.
</ul>

<p>
If you want to use the Terminal, you should probably install the
<tt>bash</tt> package, since the Terminal and <tt>ash</tt> don't seem
to like each other.
