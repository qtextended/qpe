 <li><b>How do I open files? (MP3s, MPEGs, etc.)</b>
    <p>
    Currenltly, you can use
    the File Browser to find you file and click-and-hold to bring up a menu
    where you can then Add to Documents, and the file will appear in the
    Documents tab.  
    </p>
    <p>
    The File Browser can Open files directly (ie. invoke applications to edit them).  
    </p>
    <p>
    Qt Palmtop supports a document model which is not directly keyed to
    files. Of course, ultimately files need to be accessed, but the
    interface to that is still under development.
    </p>
    <p>
    The advantages of having a layer above the file system include:
    <ul>
     <li>Two documents can have the same name (eg. you could have lots of
	    "Letter to Dad" documents, and you might access them by date
	    or by a search engine, rather than by ever-more-ridiculously
	    complex "Letter to Dad about dog", or the more typical "letter1",
	    "letter2", "letter3").
     <li>Categorization doesn't have to be partitioning (eg. you "Letter to Dad"
	    documents might be categorized in the "Dad" category and the "Letter"
	    category, while in a traditional hierarchical filesystem you would
	    have to decide on <i>ONE</i> structure from the possible choices of
	    "letters/dad" and "dad/letters"; if you chose the first option, then
	    your letters to mum would be conveniently in "letters/mum", but
	    pictures of Dad would be in a completely different area - "pictures/dad"; 
	    the reverse problem arises with the second choice.
    </ul>
    </p>
 <li><b>Is there a Web Browser?</b>
    <p>There are at least 2...
    <ol>
	<li><a href=http://www.opera.com/linux/>Opera</a>
	<li><a href=http://www.konqueror.org/embedded.html>Konqueror</a>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>and another on the way...
    <ol continue seqnum=3 start=3>
	<li><a href=http://www.geocrawler.com/mail/msg.php3?msg_id=5453266&list=135>Qt Mozilla</a>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    If you just want to view HTML <i>files</i>, the Help Browser can do that, though in
    QPE 1.4.0, it is hard-wired to access the HTML files in <tt>$QPEDIR/doc</tt>.
