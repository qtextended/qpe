Creating a unattended PPP connection.

On trying to create a connection between a Windows 2000 box and the IPaq, it
was discovered that there was a strange issue with the Direct Connection 
driver.  It caused problems on opening up a terminal to do the login.  
Furthermore, scripting appeared to be broken, at least on Service Pack 2.  
So we needed to come up with an alternate way to make a connection, not 
involving a login.  

On a direct cable connection, Windows 2000 sends CLIENT over the line, 
expecting something from the server to be sent back before it will start its 
PPP communication.  What follows is what are instructions for modifying the
IPaq to accept Windows 2000 connections, Configuring Windows 2000 to connect
to the IPaq, and the modifications that need to be done to a Linux machine
to connect to the IPaq again.  I'll finish it off with a few known issues.

Setting up the IPaq (Server).

Setting up the IPaq is fairly painless.  Just install the ppp.ipk
If that is not an option, here are the relevant changes you need to make.

1. First back up these files: /etc/hosts, /etc/ppp/options, and /etc/inittab.
2. Make you hosts file look like the following. Note that IPaq will be the
   address of your device and desktop the IP of you machine.
    #/etc/hosts
    127.0.0.1       localhost familiar
    192.168.1.101   ipaq
    192.168.1.100   desktop
3. Create a /etc/ppp/scripts directory.
4. Add the file, winclient.chat, to /etc/ppp/scripts.  It will look like:
    # /etc/ppp/options/winclient.chat
    TIMEOUT 3600
    CLIENT CLIENTSERVER\c
5. Make your /etc/ppp/options file look like this, you may have
   to replace the connect line with the proper chat location:
    #/etc/ppp/options
    connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -s -f /etc/ppp/scripts/winclient.chat'
    -detach
    asyncmap 0
    crtscts
    local
    lock
    /dev/ttySA0
    115200
    ipaq:desktop
6. Now you have to edit you /etc/inittab, since this is a fairly large file,
   I will tell you what to change.  At the bottom of the file there is
   probably a reference to a getty process that runs on the serial port that
   looks something like this.
    T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttySA0 115200 vt100 
   We want to pppd running on this port too, and we can't have getty running
   at the same time.  So remove the above getty line and add these two lines.
    T0:45:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttySA0 115200 vt100
    pd:23:respawn:/usr/sbin/pppd /dev/ttySA0 -detach
   What this does is create a pppd process that will listen at run levels 2 and
   3.  And a getty process at run levels 4 and 5.  This is an insurance method.
   This way you can use the terminal in the Qt Palmtop Environment and change 
   the run level to run a getty on the serial console in case you would need
   the it.
7. Okay that's it, either have init re-read the file by running init q or
   reboot the IPaq, which ever is more convenient.

Setting Up the Windows 2000 (Client)
 
Setting up the Windows 2000 connection is also fairly painless. Follow the steps
below, it doesn't hurt to be in the Administrator group.  First we need to 
make sure that Windows 2000 knows that you want a serial connection.  While the 
New Connection Wizard will normally allow you to pick the correct port, 
sometimes it won't.  To avoid problems, we'll install it ourselves.
 
To install the "serial cradle"
1. Load up the Control Panel (Select Settings*Control Panel from the Start Menu)
2. Select Phones and Modems.
3. Select the Modem Tab and then click the New... Button.
4. In the Dialog that pops up, check the "Don't Detect I will select from 
   a list" option.
5. In the standard modem types group, select the Communications Cable Between
   Two Computers.  Then click next.
6. Select the COM port that your IPaq is connected to, then click Finish.

Now the connection can be made.
1.  Select Start*Settings*Network and Dial-Up Connections
2.  Select "Make New Connection".  This fires up the New Connection Wizard.
3.  In the wizard that shows up, select next to get past the introductory screen
4.  Select "Connect Directly to Another Computer", then click "Next".
5.  Select the COM port that your IPaq is connected to, then click "Next".
6.  Enter a meaningful name for your newly created connection and then click
    "Finish".
7.  You will then be presented with a dialog asking for a user name and password
    Just click cancel.
8.  Right click on your new connection and select properties.
9.  Click on the "Configure" button in the General tab.
10. Choose the proper connection speed (in this case 115200)
11. Uncheck the "Enable Hardware Flow Control" option.
12. Close the Modem Configuration Dialog by clicking Ok
13. In the Options Tab, uncheck the "Prompt for Name, Password, certificate, 
    etc." option.
14. In the Networking Tab, uncheck the "File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft
    Networks" and "Client for Microsoft Networks" options.  In other words, only
    the "Internet Protocol(TCP/IP)" should be checked.
15. You are done, click "Ok".

Select your new connection and it a progress dialog should show up, and soon your
Windows 2000 machine and the IPaq are happily passing PPP frames back and 
fourth.

Setting up a Linux Box (Client)

Since we've changed the way the IPaq deals with connections, we also need to
change the way a Linux client would connect to the IPaq.  Basically, the options
file needs to be changed. We also need to emulate Windows 2000's need to emit
CLIENT at the beginning.  Here is the chat script for that, which I would 
recommend putting in /etc/ppp/scripts as winserver.chat 
    #/etc/ppp/scripts/winserver.chat
    TIMEOUT 10
    '' CLIENT\c

Here is the new peers file for the Linux client.
    #/etc/ppp/peers/ipaq
    -detach
    local
    nocrtscts
    lock
    /dev/modem
    connect '/usr/bin/chat -f /etc/ppp/scripts/winserver.chat'
    115200
Please note that /dev/modem is a symlink that whatever COM port your IPaq is
on.  Replace it appropriately, or create the symlink yourself.  After that, you
should be able to just type 'pppd call ipaq' and play happily with your IPaq.

Known Issues:
Here are a few known issues that aren't addressed in this document, several
are on the shortcomings of the Windows 2000 Connection.
* If your screen blanks out, pppd suspends itself and the Windows 2000 ppp
  implementation will die, however when it awakens, pppd on the IPaq will
  be fine and won't exit, making it impossible to run connect again.
  The best workaround for this is to disable screen blanking by uncheck-ing
  the "Blank after some inactivity" option in the Light Settings in Qt
  Palmtop Settings tab. If this does happen to you, the path to least 
  resistance is to reboot.
* When the direct cable connection is enabled on Windows 2000, the routing table
  is changed, effectively making it impossible to use the Internet.
