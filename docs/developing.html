To add functionality to the Qt Palmtop Environment, download the
sourcecode to both Qt/Embedded and the Qt Palmtop Environment
from Trolltech's website (http://www.trolltech.com). The API used
is the same as normal Qt for X11 and Windows, so you can choose to
develop your applications there first, but keep in mind the much
smaller screen size that the Qt Palmtop Environment is intended
to be used on.
