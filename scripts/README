These scripts are for convienence only.

Use them at your own risk.

Especially q_add_variable and q_add_function,
however when used they should leave behind a backup copy of the
header file it has tried to modify. Sometimes those two scripts
find headers that it decides it can't parse and leaves it up to
the user to edit them manually.

But even still I would highly recommend backing up your files
or using this in conjuction with some kind of CVS like system.

The script to add a new application is the most useful script
and creates a very basic QPE app from a template with most of
the files you need.

Currently these scripts don't integrate with a CVS system and
add or edit the created/modified files with the repository, you
have to do that manually, however I have started to make a few
scripts that are generic repository accessing scripts that
could be made to work with either p4 or cvs or something else.
